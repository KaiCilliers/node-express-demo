Just some notes that was mentioned in the lecture

    - Never trust that data that the client sends you.
    Always validate the input
    - PUT logic
        - Look up the item
        - If it does no exist, return 404
        - If exists, validate input
        - If invalid input, return 400
        - If valid input, update item and return updated item to client
    - DELETE logic
        - Look up the item
        - If it does not exist, return 404
        - If exist, delete item and return item to client
- Setting environment varaibles in powershell
    - $env.PORT=5000
    - env.NODE_ENV="production"
- You should save passwords in environment varaibles
    - save the reference in a file called 'custom-environment-variables.json'
    - map the environment values to varaibles
    - $env:my_password=1234
- Logging related
    - set an environmental variable to determine which logs to output
    - $env:DEBUG="app:startup"
    - namespace is custom :)
    - you can even set up multiple namespaces
        - $env:DEBUG="app.db,app:startup"
        - $env:BEDUG="app.*"
- Templating Engines
    - Used for HTML markup responses
    - Not really relevant
