Just some notes that was mentioned in the lecture

    - Never trust that data that the client sends you.
    Always validate the input
    - PUT logic
        - Look up the item
        - If it does no exist, return 404
        - If exists, validate input
        - If invalid input, return 400
        - If valid input, update item and return updated item to client
